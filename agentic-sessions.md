```yaml
name: Corona PCAP Processor CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12', '3.13']

```yaml
- name: Test with pytest
  run: |
    pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=xml

- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: false
```

#### Metrics Validation
Added a validation job to ensure metrics match the Corona standard:

```yaml
validate:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # Setup steps...
    
    - name: Clone Corona Standard Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        repository: aceiot/corona-standard
        path: corona-standard
        
    - name: Generate sample metrics
      run: |
        python corona_metrics.py sample-pcap.pcap sample-metrics.ttl
        
    - name: Validate metrics against Corona standard
      run: |
        cd corona-standard
        python validate_model.py ../sample-metrics.ttl --analyze
```

### Future Improvements

1. **Deployment Pipeline**: Add automatic PyPI package publishing
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Implement pre-commit hooks for local development
3. **Documentation Site**: Automate generation and deployment of documentation
4. **Container Building**: Add Docker container building and publishing

### File Rename for Simplicity
Simplified the codebase by standardizing on a single metrics generator file:

```bash
# Renamed the file
mv corona_metrics_rdflib.py corona_metrics.py

# Updated import statements in dependent files
# Updated wrapper script
```

This change streamlines the codebase by:
1. Consolidating to a single canonical implementation
2. Simplifying imports and dependencies
3. Making the codebase more intuitive for new contributors

## Session 3: Project Restructuring and Cleanup

### Summary
In this session, we performed a comprehensive restructuring and cleanup of the Corona PCAP Processor project:

1. **Code Cleanup and Organization**
   - Moved unused debug and test files to backup (.bak) format for review
   - Created a dedicated tests directory with proper Python package structure
   - Fixed imports and references to ensure proper module discovery
   - Created a convenience wrapper script for easier execution

2. **Test Suite Improvements**
   - Updated test paths and imports for the new structure
   - Fixed test assertions to work with rdflib's output format
   - Ensured all tests pass consistently with the refactored code

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Revised README.md to reflect project improvements and structure
   - Updated project structure documentation
   - Added clear usage instructions for both direct and wrapper script execution
   - Added documentation about recent improvements

### Key Changes

#### Project Structure
We reorganized the project with a cleaner structure:

```
corona-pcap-processor/
├── main.py                  # Main BACnet PCAP analyzer
├── corona_metrics_rdflib.py # Metrics generator using rdflib
├── corona-metrics           # Convenience wrapper script
├── tests/                   # Test suite directory
│   ├── __init__.py          # Package marker
│   ├── test_metrics.py      # Tests for metrics generator
│   ├── test_pcap_processor.py # Tests for PCAP processor
│   └── validate_metrics.py  # Utility to validate metrics against Corona standard
├── pcaps/                   # Sample PCAP files
├── *.pcap, *.pcap.gz        # Various sample PCAP files for testing
└── *.bak                    # Backup files (older implementations)
```

#### Test Module Updates
We updated test imports to work with the new directory structure:

```python
import sys
import os

# Add parent directory to path to access modules
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))

from main import BACnetPcapAnalyzer
from corona_metrics_rdflib import CoronaMetricsGenerator
```

#### Entry Point Script
We created a simple wrapper script to make execution easier:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
Corona BACnet Metrics Generator CLI wrapper
"""

from corona_metrics_rdflib import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Benefits

1. **Improved organization**: Clear separation between core code and tests
2. **Better maintainability**: Cleaner project structure makes future development simpler
3. **Enhanced usability**: Easier to execute with the wrapper script
4. **Better testing**: More reliable test suite with proper package structure

### Implementation Details

#### Test Adaptations
Fixed test assertions to accommodate rdflib's Turtle serialization format:

```python
# Looking for either format depending on rdflib's serialization
network_interface_found = "a corona:NetworkInterfaceMetric" in content or \
                         "corona:NetworkInterfaceMetric" in content
self.assertTrue(network_interface_found,
            "NetworkInterfaceMetric type not found in TTL file")
```

#### Python Package Structure
Added proper package structure with `__init__.py` files for better module discovery and consistent imports.

### Future Improvements

1. **CI Integration**: Add GitHub Actions or similar CI pipelines for automated testing
2. **Documentation**: Add more detailed API documentation
3. **Deployment**: Implement proper packaging for PyPI distribution
4. **Config Files**: Add configuration file support for customizable behavior

## Session 2: Improved Metrics and WhoHas/IHave Support

### Summary
In this session, we improved the Corona metrics generation by:

1. **Eliminated ambiguous metric names**
   - Replaced generic metrics with explicit "Sent" versions to clearly indicate observed activity
   - Removed metrics that implied reception when we can only observe sending from a packet capture

2. **Added WhoHas/IHave message support**
   - Extended the metrics to track WhoHas requests
   - Added support for IHave responses 
   - Added proper testing for these message types

3. **Improved metric consistency**
   - Renamed totalRequests to totalRequestsSent
   - Renamed successfulResponses to totalResponsesSent
   - Ensured proper classification of messages as requests or responses

### Key Changes

#### Metric Improvements
We redesigned the metrics to focus only on observed actions:

```python
"whoIsRequestsSent": 0,       # WhoIs requests sent by this device
"iAmResponsesSent": 0,        # IAm responses sent by this device
"whoHasRequestsSent": 0,      # WhoHas requests sent by this device
"iHaveResponsesSent": 0,      # IHave responses sent by this device
"readPropertyRequestsSent": 0, # ReadProperty requests sent by this device
"readPropertyResponsesSent": 0, # ReadProperty responses sent by this device
"totalRequestsSent": 0,        # Total requests sent by this device
"totalResponsesSent": 0,       # Total responses sent by this device
```

#### Updated Update Method
We redesigned the _update_device_metrics method to properly categorize messages:

```python
# Handle WhoHas/IHave requests
if "WhoHasRequest" in stats.message_types:
    count = stats.message_types["WhoHasRequest"]
    device_metrics["whoHasRequestsSent"] += count
    device_metrics["globalWhoHasRequestsSent"] += count
    total_requests += count

if "IHaveRequest" in stats.message_types:
    count = stats.message_types["IHaveRequest"]
    device_metrics["iHaveResponsesSent"] += count
    total_responses += count
```

#### Added Unit Tests
We implemented specialized tests to verify the new metrics:

```python
def test_whohas_ihave_support(self):
    """Test specific support for WhoHas and IHave messages."""
    # Create an analyzer with a sample WhoHas/IHave packet
    analyzer = BACnetPcapAnalyzer()
    
    # Create a metrics generator with a simulated WhoHas/IHave interaction
    metrics_gen = CoronaMetricsGenerator(analyzer)
    
    # Manually inject some test metrics to simulate messages
    device_metrics = metrics_gen._initialize_metrics()
    
    # Simulate messages and verify correct metrics
    # ...
```

### Benefits

1. **More accurate metrics**: Metrics now accurately represent what was observed in the packet capture

2. **Clearer semantics**: Each metric has a clear and unambiguous meaning focused on source

3. **Better telemetry**: Added support for more BACnet message types for comprehensive monitoring

4. **Improved testing**: Added direct tests for the new metrics

### Implementation Details

The key insight in this implementation is that a PCAP capture only lets us observe packets that were sent by devices, not how they're received or processed. Therefore, all metrics should focus on the sender's perspective.

For example, rather than tracking both `whoIsRequestsSent` and `whoIsRequestsReceived`, we now only track `whoIsRequestsSent` as that's all we can definitively observe from the packet capture.

## Session 1: Refactoring to RDFLib and Test Suite Creation

### Summary
In this session, we accomplished two major improvements to the Corona PCAP Processor:

1. **Refactored Corona Metrics Generator using RDFLib**
   - Replaced manual string formatting with RDFLib's graph-based representations
   - Improved maintainability and flexibility of the code
   - Properly modeled BACnet and Corona metrics using standard RDF/OWL semantics
   - Added better typed literal support via XSD datatypes

2. **Created a comprehensive test suite**
   - Implemented tests for the BACnet PCAP analyzer functionality
   - Added tests for Corona metrics generation
   - Created tests for RDF graph structure validation
   - Added specific test cases for address handling and message processing
   - Implemented tests for the capture device feature

### Key Files

- **corona_metrics_rdflib.py**: Refactored implementation of the metrics generator
- **test_metrics.py**: Comprehensive test suite for PCAP analysis and metrics generation

### Major Improvements

#### RDFLib Implementation
The refactoring to RDFLib provides several advantages:

1. **Improved abstraction**: Using RDF triples provides a clean separation between data model and serialization
2. **Better type safety**: Using XSD datatypes ensures proper representation of literals
3. **More maintainability**: Less string manipulation leads to fewer bugs and more readable code
4. **Enhanced querying capabilities**: The graph structure allows for more sophisticated data analysis

#### Test Suite Design
The test suite provides comprehensive verification:

1. **BACnet Analysis Tests**:
   - Verifies that PCAPfiles are correctly processed
   - Ensures devices are properly identified
   - Validates forwarded packets detection

2. **Metrics Generation Tests**:
   - Checks that metrics are correctly collected from analyzer data
   - Validates RDF graph structure and relationships
   - Verifies TTL export functionality

3. **Specialized Tests**:
   - Tests for BACnet address parsing and handling
   - Validation of MS/TP MAC address conversion
   - Verification of consistency between different metrics
   - Testing of the capture device feature and observedFrom relationships

### Implementation Details

#### Address Type Detection
The address type detection logic was standardized and improved:

```python
@staticmethod
def _get_address_type(bacnet_address: str) -> Tuple[str, str, str, bool]:
    """
    Analyze a BACnet address and return its components and type.
    
    Args:
        bacnet_address: A BACnet address in the format "network:mac"
        
    Returns:
        A tuple containing (network, mac, address_type, is_mstp)
        where address_type is one of "ip", "mstp", or "network"
    """
    network = "0"
    mac = ""
    address_type = "ip"
    is_mstp = False
    
    if ":" in bacnet_address:
        parts = bacnet_address.split(":", 1)
        network = parts[0]
        mac = parts[1]
        
        # Check if this is a non-local network
        if network != "0":
            is_mstp = True
            
            # Determine if this is an MS/TP address (typically short MAC address)
            # or a general remote network address
            if len(mac) <= 4:
                address_type = "mstp"
            else:
                address_type = "network"
        else:
            # Local network with IP address
            address_type = "ip"
    
    return network, mac, address_type, is_mstp
```

#### RDF Graph Building
The RDF graph building was organized into specialized methods:

```python
def _build_rdf_graph(self):
    """Build the RDF graph from collected metrics."""
    # Add capture device if specified
    capture_device_uri = None
    if self.capture_device:
        # Create a URI for the capture device
        capture_device_uri = self.EX[f"capture_{clean_address}"]
        
        # Add the capture device to the graph
        self.graph.add((capture_device_uri, RDF.type, self.CORONA.CaptureDevice))
        # ...additional properties...
    
    # Add device and interface data
    for device_key, data in self.device_metrics.items():
        # Extract device info and metrics
        device_info = data["info"]
        metrics = data["metrics"]
        
        if isinstance(device_key, int):
            # This is a device with a device ID
            self._add_device_to_graph(device_key, device_info, metrics, capture_device_uri)
        else:
            # This is an interface-only entry
            self._add_interface_to_graph(device_key, device_info, metrics, capture_device_uri)
```

#### Capture Device Support
The capture device feature was enhanced to properly handle the Corona `observedFrom` relationship:

```python
# Add observedFrom relationship if capture device provided
if capture_device_uri:
    self.graph.add((interface_uri, self.CORONA.observedFrom, capture_device_uri))
```

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **MS/TP Address Formatting**
   - **Challenge**: MS/TP addresses needed to be converted from hex strings to integers
   - **Solution**: Added explicit hex-to-int conversion with error handling

2. **Metrics Consistency**
   - **Challenge**: Some metrics weren't consistently calculated
   - **Solution**: Added explicit handling for IAm responses to ensure they are counted as successful responses

3. **Graph Query Complexity**
   - **Challenge**: Working with RDF graphs requires different query patterns
   - **Solution**: Implemented helper methods to simplify graph construction and queries

### Future Improvements

1. **SPARQL Query Support**: Add support for more complex graph queries using SPARQL
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for malformed BACnet addresses
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize graph construction for large PCAP files
4. **Visualization**: Add RDF graph visualization tools for better analysis
5. **Ontology Expansion**: Further develop the Corona metrics ontology for richer representations
